This mod adds snow-like layers for a bunch of blocks including grass, sand, gravel and leaves. They are very useful for making smoother landscapes. Here is a quickly created example of a slope using grass layers.

You can craft layers using the stonecutter or the crafting table depending on the type of block.

To shave off a single layer, right click while sneaking. This action also converts a block to 8 layers. You must have the correct tool (Pickaxe / Hoe / Shovel) depending on the block for this to work.

You can also sneak when placing layers to place 4 at a time (half a block).

## Available Layers

**Pickaxe:**
Andesite, Cobblestone, Diorite, Granite, Mossy Cobblestone, Stone, Sandstone, Red Sandstone, Cobbled Deepslate, Deepslate, Netherrack, Blackstone, Basalt, Crimson Nylium, Warped Nylium, Obsidian, Crying Obsidian, End Stone

**Hoe:**
Leaves (all 9 types), Hay Block

**Shovel:**
Coarse Dirt, Dirt, Dirt Path, Mycelium, Podzol, Mud, Concrete Powder (all 16 colors), Gravel, Red Sand, Sand

## Changes from the original mod

- Updated to newer Minecraft versions, with layers for some of the new blocks
- Hoe is the default tool for layers of leaves and hay blocks
- Improved placement logic
- Data for all assets are generated at runtime, using ARRP/BRRP
